# ChronoPay

ChronoPay is a Bukkit plugin for rewarding players with money for online time.
Originally made a number of years ago for a smaller Minecraft server I play on,
I'm now open sourcing it, making it available publicly, and continuing development. ðŸŽ‰

## Versioning

ChronoPay is built for Java 8 using Gradle.
It should work on pretty much any version of CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper, etc. that you're running,
but feel free to contact me if you run into any problems.

Version numbers roughly follow the [Semantic Versioning Guidelines](https://semver.org).

Version 4.0.0 is an in-progress rewrite of the plugin to try to alleviate the complexity that's
been introduced through numerous updates, as well as add some convenient new features.
